# UX Fixes - Completed

## ✅ 1. Fixed Search Input Blocking
**Problem:** After typing 2 characters, further typing was blocked until search completed.

**Solution:**
- Removed `disabled={searching}` from input field
- Moved `setSearching(true)` inside the debounced function
- Input now stays responsive while search is in progress
- Only the search button is disabled during search

## ✅ 2. Added Sticky Footer to Add Card Modal
**Problem:** Add Card modal didn't have sticky footer like Edit Card modal.

**Solution:**
- Added flexbox layout: header (fixed) → content (scrollable) → footer (sticky)
- Search form and results now scroll independently
- Consistent UX across both modals
- Better usability on smaller screens

## ✅ 3. Removed Hydration Warning Suppression
**Note:** User disabled Grammarly for localhost, so suppression was removed.

## Testing:
1. **Search responsiveness** - Type continuously, input should never block
2. **Sticky footer** - Scroll search results, buttons stay visible
3. **Debouncing** - Search waits 500ms after typing stops
4. **Auto-search** - Starts automatically after 2 characters
